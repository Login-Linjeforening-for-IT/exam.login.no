# exam.login.no
Website to practice for exams written in Nextjs, TypeScript and Tailwind.
This website is a complete implementation of a card based learning website with all functionality implemented.
In theory this website could be put in production and work out of the box.

## Building
To start the frontend run `docker compose up`. This will start the website on port 3000.
No secrets or extra configuration is necesarry, just make sure that the port is availabe, and to start the image api if you want real images.
